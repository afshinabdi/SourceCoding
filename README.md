# Source Coding and Data Compression

This repository contains implementation of different source coding algorithms which I used for various projects such as distributed deep learning. The codes are mostly written in C++. To create the python packages, I used [boost](https://www.boost.org/) libraries.

The implemented algorithms are:
  - *Entropy Coding*: variations of (adaptive) arithmetic coding
  - *Distributed Source Coding*: both binary and non-binary [DISCUS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1184140) based on the LDPC codes
  - *Designing LDPC Codes*
